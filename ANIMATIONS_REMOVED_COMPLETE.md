## What Remains

### ‚úÖ Homepage Typing Animation (KEPT)

**Location:** `frontend/src/app/page.jsx`

- "Welcome to BrightBuy" with rotating messages
- Uses TextType component with GSAP
- Cycles through 4 messages with typing effect

### ‚úÖ Loading Spinners (KEPT)

**Reason:** These are functional indicators, not decorative animations

- `animate-spin` class for loading states
- Used across all pages when fetching data

**Reason:** These are UI feedback, not page animations

- Button hover effects (`hover:opacity-90`)

- Transition colors (`transition-colors`)

### ‚úÖ Dropdown Rotations (KEPT)

**Reason:** These are functional UI indicators

- Arrow rotation in inventory (expand/collapse)
- `rotate-180` for indicating expanded state

## Technical Changes

```javascript
animation: {
  "slide-in": "slideIn 0.3s ease-out",
},
keyframes: {
  slideIn: {
    "0%": { transform: "translateX(100%)", opacity: "0" },
    "100%": { transform: "translateX(0)", opacity: "1" },
  },
},
```

### tailwind.config.js - AFTER:

```javascript
// Animation section completely removed
```

```jsx
<div className="fixed top-4 right-4 z-50 animate-slide-in">
