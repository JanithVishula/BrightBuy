# Product Delete Feature - FIXED ✅

## Error

```
DELETE http://192.168.8.129:5001/api/staff/products/47
[HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found]
```

## Root Cause

The delete endpoint `/api/staff/products/:productId` didn't exist in the backend routes.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Route (`backend/routes/staff.js`)

```javascript
// Product management routes (All staff)
router.delete(
  "/products/:productId",
  authenticate,
  authorizeStaff,
  staffController.deleteProduct
);
```

### 2. Added Model Function (`backend/models/productModel.js`)

```javascript
// Delete product and all its variants
static async deleteProduct(productId) {
  try {
    // Delete will cascade to ProductVariant and ProductCategory due to foreign key constraints
    const sql = `DELETE FROM Product WHERE product_id = ?`;
    const [result] = await db.query(sql, [productId]);
    return result.affectedRows;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 3. Added Controller Function (`backend/controllers/staffController.js`)

```javascript
exports.deleteProduct = async (req, res) => {
  // 1. Check if product exists
  // 2. Check if any variants are in orders (RESTRICT constraint)
  // 3. Check if any variants are in carts (RESTRICT constraint)
  // 4. Delete product if safe (cascades to variants, inventory, categories)
  // 5. Handle errors with specific messages
};
```

## How It Works

### Database Cascade Behavior:

When a product is deleted:

- ✅ **ProductCategory** entries deleted (CASCADE)
- ✅ **ProductVariant** entries deleted (CASCADE)
- ✅ **Inventory** entries deleted (CASCADE via variant delete)

### Database Restrictions:

Product CANNOT be deleted if:

- ❌ Any variant is in **OrderItem** (RESTRICT constraint)
- ❌ Any variant is in **CartItem** (RESTRICT constraint)

### Frontend Flow:

1. User clicks "Remove Product" button
2. Confirmation dialog: "Are you sure?"
3. DELETE request to `/api/staff/products/:productId`
4. Backend validates and deletes
5. Success: Product removed, inventory refreshed
6. Error: Show specific error message

### Backend Validation:

```javascript
// Check if product has been ordered
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM OrderItem oi
JOIN ProductVariant pv ON oi.variant_id = pv.variant_id
WHERE pv.product_id = ?

// Check if product is in carts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CartItem ci
JOIN ProductVariant pv ON ci.variant_id = pv.variant_id
WHERE pv.product_id = ?
```

## Error Messages

### Success:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Product and all its variants deleted successfully"
}
```

### Product Not Found:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Product not found"
}
```

### Has Orders:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Cannot delete product - it has been ordered by customers. You can only update stock to 0 to hide it."
}
```

### In Carts:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Cannot delete product - it is currently in customer carts. Please try again later."
}
```

### Database Constraint Error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Cannot delete product - it is referenced in orders or carts."
}
```

## Security

- ✅ Requires authentication (`authenticate` middleware)
- ✅ Requires staff role (`authorizeStaff` middleware)
- ✅ Validates product exists before delete
- ✅ Checks business rules (orders, carts)
- ✅ Handles SQL injection (parameterized queries)

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete a product with ID 47:

1. **Product** table: Row with product_id = 47
2. **ProductVariant** table: All rows with product_id = 47 (CASCADE)
3. **ProductCategory** table: All rows with product_id = 47 (CASCADE)
4. **Inventory** table: All rows with variant_id from deleted variants (CASCADE)

### What Does NOT Get Deleted:

- **OrderItem**: Protected by RESTRICT (orders are historical records)
- **CartItem**: Protected by RESTRICT (customer carts)
- **Category**: Categories remain (other products may use them)

## Testing Checklist

### Can Delete (New Product):

✅ Product created but never ordered  
✅ Product with variants  
✅ Product with inventory  
✅ Product in categories  
✅ Product with images

### Cannot Delete (Referenced):

❌ Product with variants in orders  
❌ Product with variants in customer carts

### UI Behavior:

✅ Confirmation dialog appears  
✅ Success message shown  
✅ Product removed from list  
✅ Inventory refreshed  
✅ Error messages clear and specific

## Alternative: Soft Delete (Future Enhancement)

Instead of hard delete, consider adding:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Product ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
ALTER TABLE ProductVariant ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
```

Benefits:

- Keep historical order data intact
- Allow "un-deleting" products
- Hide products from customers without deletion
- Better audit trail

## API Endpoint

```
DELETE /api/staff/products/:productId
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Role: Staff (Level01 or Level02)

Response:
- 200: Success
- 400: Cannot delete (has orders/carts)
- 404: Product not found
- 401: Not authenticated
- 403: Not staff
- 500: Server error
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend/routes/staff.js` - Added DELETE route
2. ✅ `backend/controllers/staffController.js` - Added deleteProduct function
3. ✅ `backend/models/productModel.js` - Added deleteProduct model method

**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Date**: 2024  
**Impact**: Staff can now delete products (with business rule validation)  
**Security**: Full authentication and authorization  
**Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned data
