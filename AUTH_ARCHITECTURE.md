# Authentication System Architecture - BrightBuy

## Database Schema

### Table Structure

The authentication system uses THREE tables:

1. **`users`** - Central authentication table
   - `user_id` (PK)
   - `email` (unique)
   - `password_hash`
   - `role` (customer, staff, manager, admin)
   - `is_active`
   - `created_at`
   - `last_login`
   - `customer_id` (FK to Customer table, NULL for staff)
   - `staff_id` (FK to Staff table, NULL for customers)

2. **`Customer`** - Customer-specific information
   - `customer_id` (PK)
   - `first_name`
   - `last_name`
   - `user_name`
   - `email`
   - `phone`
   - `password_hash` (duplicate for legacy, but `users` table is source of truth)

3. **`Staff`** - Staff-specific information
   - `staff_id` (PK)
   - `user_name`
   - `email`
   - `phone`
   - `role` (Level01, Level02, admin, manager)
   - `password_hash` (duplicate for legacy, but `users` table is source of truth)

## How It Works

### Registration (Signup)
1. User submits: name, email, password, phone (optional)
2. Backend creates **TWO records**:
   - **Customer record**: Stores name (split into first/last), email, username, phone
   - **users record**: Stores email, password_hash, role='customer', links to customer_id
3. Both use the SAME password_hash
4. Transaction ensures both are created or neither

### Login
1. User submits: email, password
2. Backend queries **users table** for authentication
3. **JOINS with Customer OR Staff** to get the name:
   ```sql
   SELECT u.*, 
          COALESCE(CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name), s.user_name) as name
   FROM users u
   LEFT JOIN Customer c ON u.customer_id = c.customer_id
   LEFT JOIN Staff s ON u.staff_id = s.staff_id
   WHERE u.email = ?
   ```
4. Verifies password against `users.password_hash`
5. Returns JWT token with user info

### Get Current User (getMe)
1. Receives JWT token
2. Extracts userId from token
3. Queries **users table** with JOIN to get complete user info
4. Returns user profile

## Why This Design?

### âœ… Advantages:
- **Single source of truth** for authentication (users table)
- **Separation of concerns**: Authentication vs. Profile data
- **Flexible**: Can link to either Customer or Staff
- **Role-based access**: Role stored in users table
- **Maintains legacy data**: Customer and Staff tables still exist

### ðŸ“Š Data Flow:

```
Signup:
  Frontend â†’ Backend â†’ Customer table (name, email, phone)
                    â†’ users table (email, password, role, customer_id)

Login:
  Frontend â†’ Backend â†’ users table JOIN Customer/Staff â†’ Verify password â†’ JWT

GetMe:
  Frontend â†’ Backend â†’ users table JOIN Customer/Staff â†’ User profile
```

## Current Database State

```sql
-- Check users
SELECT u.user_id, u.email, u.role, u.customer_id, u.staff_id,
       COALESCE(CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name), s.user_name) as name
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN Customer c ON u.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN Staff s ON u.staff_id = s.staff_id;
```

## Test Users

| Email | Password | Role | Linked To |
|-------|----------|------|-----------|
| kalharajay@gmail.com | admin123 | customer | Customer #6 |
| customer@brightbuy.com | admin123 | customer | Customer #7 |
| admin@brightbuy.com | admin123 | admin | Staff #1 |
| manager@brightbuy.com | admin123 | manager | Staff #2 |
| test@test.com | (from signup) | customer | Customer #10 |
| test2@test.com | (from signup) | customer | Customer #11 |

## Fixed Issues

1. âœ… Login was trying to query `users.name` which doesn't exist â†’ Now JOINS to get name
2. âœ… GetMe was trying to query `users.name` â†’ Now JOINS to get name
3. âœ… Registration creates both Customer AND users records with proper linking
4. âœ… Both password hashes stored in respective tables (users is primary)
5. âœ… Comprehensive logging shows exactly what's saved where
