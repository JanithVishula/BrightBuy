**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Temporary/Test JavaScript Files Deleted

### Backend Directory (`/backend/`)

The following temporary and test JavaScript files were deleted:

1. ✅ `check-cart-procedures.js` - Cart procedures verification script
2. ✅ `check-database-images.js` - Database images checker
3. ✅ `create-staff-account.js` - Staff account creation utility
4. ✅ `create-staff-directly.js` - Direct staff creation script
5. ✅ `create-test-orders.js` - Test orders generator
6. ✅ `create-test-staff.js` - Test staff creation script
7. ✅ `generate-hash.js` - Password hash generator utility
8. ✅ `run-backorder-migration.js` - Backorder migration runner
9. ✅ `verify-order-system.js` - Order system verification script
10. ✅ `verify-variant-flow.js` - Product variant flow checker

### Root Directory

- No temporary JavaScript files found (already clean)

## Current Backend Structure

```
backend/
├── config/              # Configuration files
├── controllers/         # Route controllers
├── middleware/          # Express middleware
├── models/             # Database models
├── routes/             # API routes
├── server.js           # Main server file (KEPT)
├── package.json
├── API_DOCUMENTATION.md
└── README.md
```

## Result

- ✅ **10 temporary/test files deleted**
- ✅ **Only essential `server.js` remains in backend root**
- ✅ **All production code preserved**
- ✅ **Backend is now clean and organized**

## Notes

All test and utility scripts were temporary development tools and are no longer needed:
- Staff/order creation can be done through the API
- Database checks can be done through MySQL client
- Hash generation can be done programmatically when needed
- System verification is handled by the application itself

The backend now contains only production code and configuration.
