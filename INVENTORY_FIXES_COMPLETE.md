# Inventory & Profile Updates - Complete

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Stock Update Not Working - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Stock updates were failing silently

**Root Causes Identified**:
- Input field using string instead of proper number parsing
- Missing validation for empty/zero values
- Insufficient error logging

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ Changed input type to properly handle numbers
- ✅ Added comprehensive console logging (=== UPDATE STOCK REQUEST ===)
- ✅ Better validation before API call
- ✅ Improved error messages with specific details
- ✅ Fixed backend URL consistency (using port 5001)

**New Debug Output**:
```javascript
=== UPDATE STOCK REQUEST ===
Selected Variant: {...}
Quantity Change: 10
Notes: "Restocking"
Token: Present
Request Body: {...}
=== SERVER RESPONSE ===
Status: 200
Response Data: {...}
```

### 2. Remove Variants Merged into Add/Remove Products - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: User wanted remove variants to be part of the manage products section

**Solution**:
- ✅ Removed separate "Remove Variants" section from sidebar
- ✅ Merged variant removal into "Add/Remove Products" section
- ✅ Now shows:
  - Add Product form (with multiple variants)
  - Remove Products (entire product)
  - Remove Variants (individual variants within each product)
- ✅ Better organized with product cards showing all variants
- ✅ Individual delete buttons for each variant

**New Structure**:
```
Add/Remove Products Section:
  ├── Add New Product (with variants)
  ├── Remove Products (shows all products)
  └── Remove Variants (delete icon for each variant)
```

### 3. Backend Port Consistency - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Mixed port usage (3000 vs 5001)

**Solution**:
- ✅ All API calls now use `http://localhost:5001`
- ✅ Constant defined: `const BACKEND_URL = "http://localhost:5001"`
- ✅ Fixed in:
  - Staff inventory page
  - Customer profile page
  - Customer settings page

### 4. Logout Button Location ✅
**Answer**: The logout button is located at the **bottom of the customer profile sidebar**:
- Position: Fixed at bottom of left sidebar
- Appears below "Back to Shopping" button
- Red color for visibility
- Icon: Logout arrow icon
- Collapses with sidebar (shows only icon when sidebar is narrow)

5. **Click "Update Stock"** on any variant
6. **Enter quantity**:
   - Positive number (e.g., `10`) to add stock
   - Negative number (e.g., `-5`) to remove stock
7. **Add optional note** (e.g., "Restocking" or "Damaged goods")
8. **Click "Update Stock"** button

   Quantity Change: 10
   Notes: "Restocking"
   Token: Present

   ```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If stock update still doesn't work, check:

1. **Backend Server Running**: 
   ```powershell
   cd d:\Project\BrightBuy\backend
   npm start
   ```
   Should show: `Server running on port 5001`

2. **Authentication Token**:
   - Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Check if `authToken` exists
   - Try logging out and back in if missing

3. **Console Logs**:
   - Check frontend console for "=== UPDATE STOCK REQUEST ===" logs
   - Check backend console for "[requestId] ===== NEW UPDATE REQUEST ====="

4. **Database Connection**:
   - Backend should show MySQL connection status on startup
   - Check `.env` file has correct DB credentials
