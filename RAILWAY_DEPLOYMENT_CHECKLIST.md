## üÜò If Something Fails

### Quick Troubleshooting
1. Check Railway logs first (90% of issues visible here)
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure MySQL service is linked to backend
4. Test backend API directly (bypass frontend)
5. Check browser console for frontend errors

### Common Issues & Fixes
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| 404 errors on frontend | Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correct |
| CORS errors | Verify `CORS_ORIGIN` includes frontend domain |
| Database connection fails | Use `mysql.railway.internal` not public host |
| Port errors | Ensure `PORT=8080` in Railway |
| Build fails | Check logs, update dependencies |
