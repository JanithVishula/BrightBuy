# Recent Fixes Summary

## Date: October 20, 2025

### 1. ✅ Card Payment Status Fixed

**Location:** `backend/controllers/orderController.js`

**Issue:** When customers placed orders with card payments, the payment status was set to "pending" instead of being completed immediately.

**Solution:** Modified the payment creation logic to automatically set card payments as "completed" while Cash on Delivery remains "pending":

```javascript
// Card payments are marked as 'completed' directly, Cash on Delivery is 'pending'
const paymentStatus =
  payment_method === "Card Payment" ? "completed" : "pending";
```

**Database Schema:** The Payment table status column accepts: `'pending'`, `'completed'`, `'failed'`

**Impact:** Card payments now show as "completed" immediately upon order placement, while COD orders remain "pending" until payment is received.

### 2. ✅ Courier Tracking Section Removed

**Location:** `frontend/src/app/staff/orders/page.jsx`

**Issue:** Courier service tracking section was visible in the staff orders dashboard but was not needed for the current workflow.

**Solution:** Removed the entire "Shipment Tracking Section" which included:

- Courier service name input
- Tracking number input
- Shipment notes
- Tracking information display

**Impact:** Orders dashboard is now cleaner and focuses on essential order management without courier tracking complexity.

### 3. ✅ Currency Changed from "Rs." to "$"

**Locations:** Multiple files across the frontend

**Issue:** All currency displays showed "Rs." (Rupees) instead of "$" (Dollars).

**Solution:** Replaced all instances of "Rs." with "$" in the following files:

#### Staff Dashboard Pages:

- ✅ `frontend/src/app/staff/orders/page.jsx` - Order totals and revenue
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/staff/customers/page.jsx` - Customer spending totals
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/staff/inventory/page.jsx` - Product prices and inventory values
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/staff/dashboard/page.jsx` - Today's sales

#### Customer Pages:

- ✅ `frontend/src/app/profile/orders/page.jsx` - Order totals and spending
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/profile/help/page.jsx` - Delivery charges in FAQ

#### Other Pages:

- ✅ `frontend/src/app/admin/dashboard/page.jsx` - Revenue display
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/manager/dashboard/page.jsx` - Sales display
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/inventory/page.jsx` - Inventory values and revenue

**Examples of Changes:**

- Revenue: `Rs. 45,678` → `$ 45,678`
- Order Total: `Rs. {total}` → `$ {total}`
- Delivery: `Rs. 100` → `$100`

**Impact:** All monetary values across the application now display in USD ($) format consistently.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Card Payment Status:**

   - Place a new order with "Card Payment" method
   - Verify payment status shows as "completed" immediately
   - Check staff orders dashboard confirms "completed" status
   - Test Cash on Delivery shows "pending" status

2. **Courier Tracking Removal:**

   - Open staff orders page
   - Verify no courier tracking section appears
   - Confirm order details still show delivery mode and estimated days

3. **Currency Display:**
   - Browse through all pages (staff dashboard, customer profile, inventory, etc.)
   - Verify all amounts show "$" instead of "Rs."
   - Check that formatting remains correct (e.g., `$1,234.56`)

## Important Notes

### Payment Status Values

The database `Payment` table uses these ENUM values:

- **`'pending'`** - Payment not yet received (used for Cash on Delivery)
- **`'completed'`** - Payment successfully received (used for Card Payments)
- **`'failed'`** - Payment attempt failed

Do NOT use `'paid'` as it's not in the ENUM definition.
