## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot login
- Check backend is running on port 5001
- Check frontend is running on port 3000
- Verify database password in `.env` is correct (1234)
- Check MySQL service is running

### Issue: "Access denied" when accessing staff management
- Verify you're logged in as Level01 staff
- Check JWT token includes `staffLevel: "Level01"`
- Clear localStorage and login again

### Issue: Staff not showing in list
- Run `node create-test-staff.js` again
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM Staff;`
