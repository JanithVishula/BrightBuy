# Store Pickup Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete Store Pickup delivery option for customers, allowing them to choose between Standard Delivery (with shipping fee) and Store Pickup (free) during checkout. The system seamlessly integrates with existing database schema and provides full order management for staff.

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### File: `frontend/src/app/checkout/page.jsx`

**New State Variable**:
```javascript
const [deliveryMode, setDeliveryMode] = useState("Standard Delivery");
```

**Dynamic Shipping Cost Calculation**:
```javascript
const SHIPPING_COST = deliveryMode === "Store Pickup" ? 0 : 5.00;
```

**Conditional Form Validation**:
```javascript
const validateForm = () => {
  // ... other validations
  
  // Address fields only required for Standard Delivery
  if (deliveryMode === "Standard Delivery") {
    if (!shippingInfo.address.trim()) errors.address = "Address is required";
    if (!shippingInfo.city.trim()) errors.city = "City is required";
    if (!shippingInfo.state.trim()) errors.state = "State is required";
    if (!shippingInfo.postalCode.trim()) errors.postalCode = "Postal code is required";
  }
};
```

**Conditional Address Saving**:
```javascript
// Only save address for Standard Delivery
let addressResult = null;
if (deliveryMode === "Standard Delivery") {
  const addressData = {
    address_id: savedAddressId,
    line1: shippingInfo.address,
    line2: shippingInfo.address2,
    city: shippingInfo.city,
    state: shippingInfo.state,
    zip_code: shippingInfo.postalCode,
    is_default: 1,
  };
  addressResult = await customerAPI.saveAddress(customerId, addressData);
}
```

**Order Data Preparation**:
```javascript
const orderData = {
  customer_id: parseInt(customerId),
  address_id: deliveryMode === "Standard Delivery" ? (savedAddressId || addressResult?.address_id) : null,
  delivery_mode: deliveryMode, // "Standard Delivery" or "Store Pickup"
  delivery_zip: deliveryMode === "Standard Delivery" ? shippingInfo.postalCode : null,
  payment_method: paymentMethod === "card" ? "Card Payment" : "Cash on Delivery",
  items: orderItems,
  sub_total: subtotal,
  delivery_fee: SHIPPING_COST, // $5.00 or $0.00
  total: totalAmount,
};
```

**Success Message**:
```javascript
const deliveryMessage = deliveryMode === "Store Pickup" 
  ? "\n\nPlease collect your order from our store. We'll notify you when it's ready for pickup."
  : "\n\nYour shipping information has been saved for future orders.";

alert(`Order placed successfully!\n\nOrder ID: ${orderResult.order.order_id}\nDelivery: ${deliveryMode}\nTotal: ${formatCurrency(totalAmount)}\nPayment: ${paymentMethod === "card" ? "Card Payment" : "Cash on Delivery"}${deliveryMessage}`);
```

---

### Backend Integration

#### Database Schema Utilization
The feature uses existing schema fields - **no migration required**!

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    ...
    delivery_mode ENUM('Standard Delivery', 'Store Pickup') NOT NULL,
    delivery_zip VARCHAR(10) NULL,  -- NULL for Store Pickup
    address_id INT NULL,             -- NULL for Store Pickup
    delivery_fee DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,  -- $0.00 for Store Pickup
    ...
);
```

#### Delivery Fee Trigger
The existing `trg_compute_delivery_fee` trigger automatically handles Store Pickup:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trg_compute_delivery_fee BEFORE INSERT ON Orders
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF NEW.delivery_mode = 'Store Pickup' THEN
    SET NEW.delivery_fee = 0;
    LEAVE delivery_block;
  END IF;
  -- ... standard delivery logic
END;
```

---

### Staff Dashboard Integration

#### File: `frontend/src/app/staff/orders/page.jsx`

**Store Pickup Badge**:
```javascript
{isStorePickup && (
  <span className="px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-semibold bg-purple-100 text-purple-800">
    STORE PICKUP
  </span>
)}
```

**Conditional Courier Tracking Section**:
```javascript
{!isStorePickup && (
  <div className="courier-tracking-section">
    {/* Shipment tracking form and display */}
  </div>
)}
```

**Store Pickup Notice**:
```javascript
{isStorePickup && (
  <div className="p-4 bg-purple-50 border border-purple-200 rounded-lg">
    <h4>Store Pickup Order</h4>
    <p>Customer will collect this order from the store. No courier service required.</p>
  </div>
)}
```

**Order Details Display**:
```javascript
<p>ðŸšš Delivery: {order.delivery_mode} {order.delivery_zip && !isStorePickup && `â€¢ ZIP: ${order.delivery_zip}`}</p>
```

  delivery_zip,      -- NULL for Store Pickup
  payment_id, 
  status, 
  sub_total, 
  delivery_fee,      -- 0.00 (set by trigger)
  total
) VALUES (
  5, 
  NULL,              -- No address needed
  'Store Pickup', 
  NULL,              -- No ZIP needed
  123, 
  'pending', 
  50.00, 
  0.00,              -- Free pickup

   - Made address fields conditional
   - Updated validation logic
   - Modified order data preparation
   - Updated success message
   - Updated order summary display

---

## Configuration

### Store Information
**Update in**: `frontend/src/app/checkout/page.jsx`

```javascript
<p className="text-xs text-text-secondary mt-1">
  Store Address: 123 Main Street, Austin, TX 78701 â€¢ Mon-Sat: 9AM-7PM
</p>
```

**To customize**:
1. Change address to your actual store location
2. Update store hours
3. Add phone number if desired
4. Modify in both the delivery mode selector and any other store references

---

## API Integration

### No API Changes Required!
The existing `/api/orders` endpoint accepts:

```json
{
  "customer_id": 5,
  "address_id": null,              // NULL for Store Pickup
  "delivery_mode": "Store Pickup",
  "delivery_zip": null,            // NULL for Store Pickup
  "payment_method": "Card Payment",
  "items": [...],
  "sub_total": 50.00,
  "delivery_fee": 0.00,
  "total": 54.00
}
```

Database trigger automatically ensures:
- `delivery_fee = 0.00` for Store Pickup
- No ZIP validation required
- Address is optional (NULL allowed)

---

## Security Considerations

### Validation
- Server-side validation ensures delivery_mode is valid enum value
- Frontend validation skips address for Store Pickup
- Backend accepts NULL address_id for Store Pickup orders

### Data Integrity
- Database trigger enforces delivery_fee = 0 for Store Pickup
- ENUM constraint prevents invalid delivery modes
- Foreign key constraints maintain data consistency
