## ⚡ Super Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Link Backend to MySQL (Railway Dashboard)
```
Backend Service → Variables → New Variable → Add Reference → Select MySQL
```
Result: `DATABASE_URL` automatically created ✅

### Step 2: Add Backend Environment Variables
In Railway Backend Service → Variables:
- `PORT=8080`
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `JWT_SECRET=your_strong_secret`
- `CORS_ORIGIN=https://brightbuy-production.up.railway.app`

### Step 3: Configure Frontend
Add this to Netlify (or Railway if hosted there):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://gallant-friendship-production.up.railway.app/api
```

**Done! Deploy and test!** 🎉

## 🧪 Test Commands

### Test Backend
```powershell
# Health check
curl https://gallant-friendship-production.up.railway.app/

# Products API
curl https://gallant-friendship-production.up.railway.app/api/products

# Categories API
curl https://gallant-friendship-production.up.railway.app/api/categories
```

### Test Frontend
```powershell
# Open in browser
start https://brightbuy-production.up.railway.app

# Should load without errors, display products
```

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Backend Can't Connect to MySQL
**Solution**: Use `mysql.railway.internal` not public host

### CORS Errors on Frontend
**Solution**: Add frontend domain to `CORS_ORIGIN` in backend

### Frontend API Calls Fail
**Solution**: Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correct

### 502 Bad Gateway
**Solution**: Verify `PORT=8080` in backend variables
