## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
```
Request → Middleware (Auth) → Middleware (Staff Auth) → Controller → Database → Response
```

### Frontend Architecture
```
Page Load → Auth Check → Fetch Helper Data → User Selects Report → 
Fetch Report Data → Render Tables/Cards
```

### Data Flow
```
User Action (Filter/Tab) → State Change → useEffect Trigger → 
API Call with Filters → Update State → Re-render UI
```
