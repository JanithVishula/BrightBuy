# Signup/Registration Debugging Setup Complete

## Changes Made

### Backend (`/backend/controllers/authController.js`)
Added comprehensive console logging to track the signup process:
- ✅ Request body received
- ✅ Extracted data validation
- ✅ Email availability check
- ✅ Password hashing
- ✅ Name processing (first/last name split)
- ✅ Database transaction steps
- ✅ Customer record creation
- ✅ User record creation
- ✅ JWT token generation
- ✅ Response data sent
- ✅ Error handling with rollback

### Frontend (`/frontend/src/app/signup/page.jsx`)
Added comprehensive console logging to track form submission:
- ✅ Form data captured
- ✅ Password validation
- ✅ API request payload
- ✅ Response status and data
- ✅ LocalStorage operations
- ✅ Navigation tracking
- ✅ Error handling

### Backend Routes (`/backend/routes/auth.js`)
- ✅ Added `/signup` route as alias for `/register`
- Both endpoints now work: `/api/auth/signup` and `/api/auth/register`

## How to Test

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open the signup page:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/signup`

4. **Fill in the form and submit**

5. **Monitor the logs:**
   - **Backend terminal**: Shows detailed server-side processing
   - **Browser console** (F12): Shows detailed client-side processing

## What to Look For

### In Backend Terminal:
```
=== SIGNUP/REGISTER REQUEST ===
Request body received: { name: '...', email: '...', password: '...' }
Extracted data:
  - Name: John Doe
  - Email: john@example.com
  - Password: ***123
✓ Validation passed
✓ Email is available
✓ Password hashed successfully
Name processing:
  - First name: John
  - Last name: Doe
  - Username: john
✓ Customer created with ID: 10
✓ User created with ID: 5
✓ Transaction committed successfully
✓ JWT token generated
✅ Registration successful!
=== END SIGNUP REQUEST ===
```

### In Browser Console:
```
=== FRONTEND SIGNUP FORM SUBMISSION ===
Form data: { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com', ... }
✓ Password validation passed
Sending POST request to /api/auth/signup
Response status: 201
✅ Signup successful!
Storing token and user data in localStorage
Redirecting to home page...
=== END FRONTEND SIGNUP ===
```

## Database Schema Used

The signup process creates records in two tables:

1. **Customer table**: Stores customer personal information
   - first_name, last_name, user_name, email, phone, password_hash

2. **users table**: Authentication table linking to Customer
   - email, password_hash, role, customer_id (FK), staff_id (NULL for customers)

## Next Steps

If you see any errors, the console logs will show exactly where the process fails and what data was being processed at that point.
