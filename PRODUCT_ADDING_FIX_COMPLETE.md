# Product Adding Feature - Fixed ✅

## Summary

Fixed the product adding feature in the staff inventory dashboard and added image upload capability.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Wrong API Endpoint

- **Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/staff/products` which doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Changed to correct endpoint `/api/products`

### 2. Category Handling

- **Problem**: Frontend sent category as string, backend expected `category_id` as integer
- **Solution**:
  - Added categories state to fetch all categories from `/api/categories`
  - Changed category input to dropdown populated with available categories
  - Added logic to find category_id from selected category name before API call

### 3. Image Upload Missing

- **Problem**: No image upload functionality existed
- **Solution**:
  - Added `image` and `imagePreview` state to newProduct
  - Created `handleImageChange` function with validation (file type, size limit 5MB)
  - Added image upload form with preview
  - Image uploads to `/api/products/upload-image` endpoint before product creation
  - Returned `imageUrl` is added to all product variants

### 4. Missing Public Directory

- **Problem**: `backend/public/images/products/` directory didn't exist for uploads
- **Solution**: Created the directory structure

### 5. Category Finding Bug

- **Problem**: Code was trying to find category by comparing category_id to category name
- **Solution**: Fixed to find by matching category name: `categories.find(c => c.name === newProduct.category)`

## Changes Made

### Frontend: `frontend/src/app/staff/inventory/page.jsx`

1. **Updated State** (Lines 25-39):

```javascript
const [newProduct, setNewProduct] = useState({
  name: "",
  brand: "",
  category: "",
  image: null,
  imagePreview: null,
  variants: [{ color: "", size: "", price: "", stock: 0 }],
});

const [categories, setCategories] = useState([]);
```

2. **Added Category Fetching** (Lines 65-77):

```javascript
const fetchCategories = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/categories`);
    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      setCategories(data || []);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching categories:", error);
  }
};
```

3. **Updated handleAddProduct** (Lines 258-370):

- Added image upload before product creation
- Fixed category lookup to use category name instead of ID
- Changed endpoint to `/api/products`
- Added proper error handling for image upload
- Added `image_url` to all variants
- Proper SKU generation

4. **Added Image Handler** (Lines 428-450):

```javascript
const handleImageChange = (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  if (file) {
    // Validate file type
    if (!file.type.startsWith("image/")) {
      setMessage({ type: "error", text: "Please select an image file" });
      return;
    }

    // Validate file size (max 5MB)
    if (file.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024) {
      setMessage({ type: "error", text: "Image size must be less than 5MB" });
      return;
    }

    setNewProduct({
      ...newProduct,
      image: file,
      imagePreview: URL.createObjectURL(file),
    });
  }
};
```

5. **Updated Form JSX** (Lines 870-935):

- Changed category input to dropdown
- Added image upload section with preview
- Added remove button for image preview

### Backend: Already Working ✅

1. **Product Route**: `POST /api/products` exists in `backend/routes/products.js`
2. **Image Upload Route**: `POST /api/products/upload-image` with multer middleware
3. **Categories Route**: `GET /api/categories` exists in `backend/routes/categories.js`
4. **Static Files**: Server already serves `/images` from `backend/public/images/`

### Directory Created

- Created: `/home/kalhara/Desktop/Apps/DB-Project/BrightBuy/backend/public/images/products/`

## How It Works Now

1. **User fills product form**:

   - Product name (required)
   - Brand (required)
   - Category (required) - dropdown with all categories
   - Product image (optional) - file upload with preview
   - Variants with color, size, price (required)

2. **Validation**:

   - All required fields checked
   - At least one variant with color required
   - Price must be greater than 0
   - Image file type validation (jpeg, jpg, png, gif, webp)
   - Image size limit (5MB)

3. **Process**:

   - If image selected, upload to `/api/products/upload-image` first
   - Get `imageUrl` from upload response
   - Find `category_id` from selected category name
   - Create product data with proper structure
   - POST to `/api/products` with:
     - name, brand, category_id
     - variants array with: sku, price, size, color, image_url, is_default
   - On success, refresh inventory and reset form

4. **Image Handling**:
   - Images stored in `backend/public/images/products/`
   - Accessed via `http://your-server:5001/images/products/filename.jpg`
   - Same image URL applied to all variants of the product
   - Preview shown in form before upload

## API Flow

```
1. GET /api/categories → Load categories for dropdown
2. POST /api/products/upload-image → Upload image (if selected)
   Body: FormData with 'image' file
   Response: { imageUrl: "/images/products/12345678-filename.jpg" }

3. POST /api/products → Create product with variants
   Body: {
     name: "Product Name",
     brand: "Brand Name",
     category_id: 1,
     variants: [{
       sku: "BRA-PRO-RED-M-1234567890",
       price: 99.99,
       size: "M",
       color: "Red",
       description: null,
       image_url: "/images/products/12345678-filename.jpg",
       is_default: 1
     }]
   }
   Response: { productId: 123, message: "Product created successfully" }

4. Refresh inventory to show new product
```

## Testing Checklist

✅ Categories dropdown loads correctly  
✅ Image upload validation works (file type, size)  
✅ Image preview displays correctly  
✅ Product creation with image works  
✅ Product creation without image works  
✅ Multiple variants can be added  
✅ Category selection is required  
✅ Proper error messages shown  
✅ Form resets after successful creation  
✅ Inventory refreshes with new product

## Notes

- Initial stock is NOT set during product creation
- Users should use "Update Stocks" section to add initial inventory
- This prevents confusion and keeps inventory management separate
- All variants of a product share the same image (common in e-commerce)
- SKU is auto-generated from brand-product-color-size-timestamp pattern

## Files Modified

1. `/home/kalhara/Desktop/Apps/DB-Project/BrightBuy/frontend/src/app/staff/inventory/page.jsx` - Fixed and enhanced
2. `/home/kalhara/Desktop/Apps/DB-Project/BrightBuy/backend/public/images/products/` - Created directory

## No Database Changes Required ✅

All existing database tables and columns support this functionality:

- Product table: product_id, name, brand
- ProductVariant table: variant_id, product_id, sku, price, size, color, image_url, is_default
- ProductCategory table: product_id, category_id
- Category table: category_id, name
