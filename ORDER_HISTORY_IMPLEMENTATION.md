# Order History Feature - Implementation Summary

## Problem
Orders were not showing on the customer profile page despite having the UI code in place.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Backend - Missing Fields in API Response**
**File**: `backend/controllers/authController.js` (getMe endpoint)
- **Issue**: The `/api/auth/me` endpoint wasn't returning `customer_id` and `staff_id` fields
- **Fix**: Added these fields to the response object

### 2. **Backend - Incomplete Order Data**
**File**: `backend/controllers/orderController.js` (getOrdersByCustomer method)
- **Issue**: The SQL query wasn't returning all necessary order details with proper grouping
- **Fix**: Enhanced the query to include:
  - All order fields explicitly listed
  - Payment details (method, status, amount, transaction_id)
  - Proper GROUP BY clause with all non-aggregated columns
  - Added console logging for debugging

### 3. **Frontend - Wrong User ID Field**
**File**: `frontend/src/app/profile/page.jsx`
- **Issue**: Code was using `user.id` instead of `user.customer_id` to fetch orders
- **Fix**: Changed to use `user.customer_id` in both the useEffect condition and API call

### 4. **Database - No Test Orders**
- **Issue**: Database had no orders to display
- **Fix**: Created test orders script to populate sample data

## Files Modified

### Backend Files
1. **backend/controllers/authController.js**
   - Added `customer_id` and `staff_id` to the getMe response

2. **backend/controllers/orderController.js**
   - Enhanced `getOrdersByCustomer` SQL query
   - Added proper column listing and grouping
   - Added console logging

### Frontend Files
1. **frontend/src/app/profile/page.jsx**
   - Changed from `user.id` to `user.customer_id`
   - Added console logs for debugging
   - Orders section displays:
     - Order statistics (total, pending, delivered, total spent)
     - Last 5 recent orders with details
     - Track order and view details buttons
     - Payment status warnings

### Test Scripts Created
1. **backend/create-test-orders.js**
   - Creates 3 test orders for the first customer
   - Handles address creation if needed
   - Creates proper payment records

2. **backend/test-orders-debug.js**
   - Debugging script to check database state

## How It Works Now

### Flow:
1. **User Login**: User logs in and receives token + user object with `customer_id`
2. **Profile Page Load**: 
   - Checks if user is a customer with valid `customer_id`
   - Calls `ordersAPI.getOrdersByCustomer(user.customer_id, token)`
3. **Backend API**:
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/orders/customer/:customer_id`
   - Returns array of orders with payment and item details
4. **Frontend Display**:
   - Calculates statistics (total, pending, delivered, spent)
   - Shows statistics cards
   - Lists last 5 orders with status badges
   - Provides action buttons to track or view details

## Order Data Structure

### What Backend Returns:
```javascript
{
  orders: [
    {
      order_id: 1,
      customer_id: 1,
      status: 'delivered',
      payment_status: 'completed',
      payment_method: 'Card Payment',
      total: 599.99,
      delivery_mode: 'Store Pickup',
      item_count: 1,
      created_at: '2025-10-18...',
      // ... other fields
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing

### Test Data Created:
- **Customer**: John Doe (ID: 1)
- **Orders**:
  1. Order #7: Delivered, Rs. 599.99, Card Payment (Paid)
  2. Order #8: Shipped, Rs. 1349.99, Card Payment (Paid)
  3. Order #9: Pending, Rs. 949.99, Cash on Delivery (Pending)

### How to Test:
1. Start backend: `cd backend && node server.js`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Login as customer: john.doe@example.com (or the email in your database)
4. Navigate to profile page
5. Scroll down to see "My Orders" section

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Order Statistics Dashboard
- Total orders count
- Pending/In-progress orders
- Delivered orders count
- Total amount spent

### ✅ Recent Orders List
- Shows last 5 orders
- Order status badges (pending, paid, shipped, delivered)
- Payment status badges (pending, paid)
- Item count and total amount
- Delivery mode
- Order date

### ✅ Action Buttons
- "Track Order" - Links to `/order-tracking/{order_id}`
- "Details" - Links to `/orders/{order_id}`
- "View All Orders" - Links to `/orders` page

### ✅ Smart UI States
- Loading spinner while fetching
- Empty state with "Start Shopping" CTA
- Payment pending warnings

## Database Schema Reference

### Orders Table:
- `order_id`, `customer_id`, `status`, `total`
- `delivery_mode`, `estimated_delivery_days`
- `payment_id` (FK to Payment table)

### Payment Table:
- `payment_id`, `order_id`, `method`, `status`, `amount`
- Methods: 'Cash on Delivery', 'Card Payment'
- Status: 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'

### Order_item Table:
- Links orders to product variants
- Contains quantity and unit_price

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Create Order Details Page**: `/orders/{order_id}`
2. **Create Order Tracking Page**: `/order-tracking/{order_id}`
3. **Create All Orders Page**: `/orders` (full order history)
4. **Add Filtering**: Filter by status, date range
5. **Add Sorting**: Sort by date, amount, status
6. **Add Pagination**: For customers with many orders
7. **Staff Order Management**: Implement staff view of all customer orders

## Troubleshooting

### If orders don't show:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `user.customer_id` exists in user object
3. Check backend logs for "Fetching orders for customer X"
4. Verify orders exist in database: `SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE customer_id = 1`
5. Check authentication token is valid

### Common Issues:
- **401 Unauthorized**: Token expired or invalid
- **404 Not Found**: Wrong API endpoint or customer_id
- **Empty orders array**: No orders in database for that customer
- **customer_id is null**: User object not properly populated
