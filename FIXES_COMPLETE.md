# Staff System - Final Implementation & Fixes

## ✅ All Issues Resolved!

### Issue #1: Things Not Working
**Fixed:** Backend and Frontend servers running successfully
- Backend: http://localhost:5001 ✅
- Frontend: http://localhost:3001 ✅ (using 3001 since 3000 was in use)

---

### Issue #2: Customer Details Should Be Available for Both Staff Levels
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

Both Level 01 and Level 02 staff can access customer details:

**Location:** `/staff/customers`

**Features:**
- Search customers by name, email, or phone
- View customer list with order statistics
- Click "View Details" to see:
  - Personal information
  - Total orders and spending
  - Order history with dates
  - Saved addresses

**Access Control:**
```javascript
// backend/routes/staff.js
router.get("/customers", authenticate, authorizeStaff, staffController.getCustomers);
router.get("/customers/:customerId", authenticate, authorizeStaff, staffController.getCustomerDetails);
```

**Note:** `authorizeStaff` allows BOTH Level01 AND Level02 access ✅

**Test:**
1. Login as Level01: `admin@brightbuy.com` / `123456`
2. Click "Customer Management" button
3. See all customers ✅

OR

1. Login as Level02: `mike@brightbuy.com` / `123456`
2. Click "Customer Management" button
3. See all customers ✅

### Issue #3: Customer Support Should Have a Separate Page
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

**Location:** `/staff/support`

**Features:**
- **Statistics Dashboard:**
  - Open tickets count
  - In Progress tickets count
  - Resolved tickets count
  - High Priority tickets count

- **Ticket Management:**
  - Filter by status (All, Open, In Progress, Resolved)
  - View ticket details
  - Customer name and email
  - Priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
  - Response submission
  - Status updates

- **Visual Design:**
  - Color-coded priority badges:
    - 🔴 Red = High Priority
    - 🟠 Orange = Medium Priority
    - 🟢 Green = Low Priority
  - Color-coded status badges:
    - 🟡 Yellow = Open
    - 🔵 Blue = In Progress
    - 🟢 Green = Resolved
    - ⚪ Gray = Closed

**Access from Dashboard:**
```javascript
<Link href="/staff/support">
  <span>Customer Support</span>
</Link>
```

**Test:**
1. Login as any staff member
2. Click "Customer Support" button on dashboard
3. See support ticket dashboard with 3 sample tickets ✅
4. Click any ticket to view details
5. Type response and click "Send Response" ✅
6. Change status using dropdown ✅

**Current Implementation:**
- Uses mock data (3 sample tickets)
- Fully functional UI
- Ready for backend integration

**Future Backend Enhancement:**
```sql
-- Suggested tables for future implementation
CREATE TABLE SupportTickets (
  ticket_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  customer_id INT,
  subject VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  status ENUM('open', 'in_progress', 'resolved', 'closed'),
  priority ENUM('high', 'medium', 'low'),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE TicketResponses (
  response_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  ticket_id INT,
  staff_id INT,
  response_text TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (ticket_id) REFERENCES SupportTickets(ticket_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (staff_id) REFERENCES Staff(staff_id)
);
```

### Issue #4: Disable Buy and Add to Cart Buttons for Staff Members
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (Both Level 01 and Level 02)

**Changes Made:**

#### 1. Product Detail Page (`/products/[id]/page.jsx`)
**Before:**
- Both staff and customers saw "Add to Cart" and "Buy Now" buttons

**After:**
```jsx
// Added userRole state
const [userRole, setUserRole] = useState(null);

// Check user role
useEffect(() => {
  const userData = localStorage.getItem("user");
  if (userData) {
    const user = JSON.parse(userData);
    setUserRole(user.role);
    // Allow staff to view, just hide buy buttons
  }
}, [router]);

// Conditional rendering
{userRole !== 'staff' && (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>
      Add to Cart
    </button>
    <button>Buy Now</button>
  </div>
)}

{userRole === 'staff' && (
  <div className="p-4 bg-blue-50 border-2 border-blue-300 rounded-lg text-center">
    <i className="fas fa-info-circle text-blue-600 mr-2"></i>
    <span className="text-blue-800 font-medium">
      Product information view only. Staff members cannot make purchases.
    </span>
  </div>
)}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Staff see product information
- ✅ Staff see "Product information view only" message
- ❌ Staff cannot see "Add to Cart" button
- ❌ Staff cannot see "Buy Now" button
- ✅ Customers see everything normally

#### 2. Navbar Component (`/components/Navbar.jsx`)
**Before:**
- All users saw cart icon

**After:**
```jsx
{/* Cart Icon - Hidden for staff */}
{user?.role !== 'staff' && (
  <Link href="/cart">
    <i className="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i>
    {cartCount > 0 && <span>{cartCount}</span>}
  </Link>
)}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Cart icon hidden for staff
- ✅ Search bar hidden for staff
- ✅ Staff see "Staff Dashboard" button instead

#### 3. Cart & Checkout Pages
**Updated Files:**
- `/cart/page.jsx` - Redirects staff to dashboard
- `/checkout/page.jsx` - Redirects staff to dashboard

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const userData = localStorage.getItem("user");
  if (userData) {
    const user = JSON.parse(userData);
    if (user.role === 'staff') {
      router.push('/staff/dashboard');
      return;
    }
  }
}, [router]);
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Staff cannot access cart page
- ✅ Staff cannot access checkout page
- ✅ Auto-redirect to dashboard

#### 4. NEW: Staff Products Page (`/staff/products`)
**Created:** Read-only product viewing page for staff

**Features:**
- View all products in table format
- Search by name, SKU, or brand
- See product images, prices, stock status
- Click "View Details" to see full product page
- Blue info banner: "Information View Only - Staff members cannot make purchases"

**Columns:**
- Image thumbnail
- Product name & description
- SKU (monospace font)
- Brand
- Category
- Price range
- Stock status (color-coded)
- "View Details" link

**Access:**
```javascript
// Dashboard link
<Link href="/staff/products">
  <span>Product Information</span>
</Link>
```

**Test:**
1. Login as staff
2. Click "Product Information" on dashboard
3. See all products in table ✅
4. Search for products ✅
5. Click "View Details" on any product
6. See product detail page WITHOUT buy buttons ✅
